            You Will Be Missed
        </h2>

        <p>Saying goodbye <br>
Was the hardest thing to do.<br>
I never thought I would,<br>
Especially not to you.<br></p>

<p>You always listened<br>
And knew what to say,<br>
Knew when to give a hug<br>
When I was having a bad day.<br></p>


<p>No one will ever take your place.<br>
I can always promise you this.<br>
It's hard to find someone like you,<br>
So know you'll always be missed.<br>

<p>The past you cannot forget or undo;<br>
The future is all we can look forward to.<br></p>

<p> wish I could have been there by your side<br>
For all the times you've wept and cried.<br></p>

<p>Know from my heart what I say is true.<br>
That I hurt for the pain you have been through.<br></p>

<p>Never alone shall you be.<br>
Someday, freedom you will see.<br></p>

<p>May your hopes and dreams come true,<br>
No matter where you are, I'll always be here for you.<br></p>
